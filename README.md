HackRx 2022 Project - Team RxTopia

This project was created for, and submitted to, HackRx 2022. This submission won 2nd place. 

"Our product consists of an iOS app on the patient's end that allows for secure storage and sharing of medication records and secure one-tap sharing of structured medication history via QR code or via designating a primary pharmacy. Apple Health integration allows patients to easily share information such as blood glucose levels. On the pharmacist's end, a web app allows remote access to structured medication data from patients who have authorized them to view it. This process streamlines "MedsChecks", which can take up to 30 minutes, delaying service to other patients by the pharmacist and leading to patient dissatisfaction."
